# Indexes

Cryptocurrency indexes are financial benchmarks that measure the performance of a specific group of cryptocurrencies. They track the price movements of these cryptocurrencies over time, allowing investors and traders to monitor the overall performance of the cryptocurrency market.

There are several types of cryptocurrency indexes, each with its own methodology and set of criteria for inclusion. For example, some indexes may include only the largest and most established cryptocurrencies, while others may include a broader range of coins and tokens. Some indexes may also weigh each cryptocurrency differently based on market capitalization, trading volume, or other factors.

Cryptocurrency indexes are typically used by investors and traders to track the overall performance of the cryptocurrency market and to identify trends and investment opportunities. They can also be used as a benchmark against which to measure the performance of individual cryptocurrencies or portfolios of cryptocurrencies.

## Total
A prepared trader is defined by their ability to see a bigger picture of a market. It applies to crypto traders too — if you agree, we've prepared a chart that will let you see the whole crypto market from a bird's-eye view. It shows total crypto market cap, which is calculated by TradingView by adding up top 125 coins market caps, which, in their turn, are the number of coins times their current price. A growing market cap can indicate investors' interest and their positive evaluation of the current market state. For you it might be a good indicator of where the wind blows and whether digital coins are a good investment tool.

## Total2
Bitcoin is quite a heavy-weight fighter which makes it difficult at times to correctly define how the crypto market is doing — it just outshines other coins, and you can't see clearly. Since Bitcoin presents such a huge piece of the crypto pie, excluding it from counting sounds reasonable and lets you see a more clear picture of where the crypto market is moving at the moment. That is what you can see on the chart we've prepared — calculated by TradingView, it displays global crypto market cap without Bitcoin's share.

## BTC rainbow chart
The Rainbow Chart is a long-term valuation tool for Bitcoin. It uses a logarithmic growth curve to forecast the potential future price direction of Bitcoin.

It overlays rainbow color bands on top of the logarithmic growth curve channel in an attempt to highlight market sentiment at each rainbow color stage as price moves through it. Therefore highlighting potential opportunities to buy or sell.

To date, Bitcoin price has continued to stay within the rainbow color bands of the logarithmic growth channel.

## Bitcoin Profitable Days
Number of days in Bitcoin's traded history where holding Bitcoin has been profitable relative to today's price.

This chart highlights the aggressive growth of Bitcoin's adoption curve over time, which is reflected in its price. Because supply is limited, as demand grows price moves up.

For investors, it also demonstrates the importance of understanding the market cycles of Bitcoin to avoid buying market cycle tops. The drawdowns from cycle tops can last a long time, around 2-3 years in previous cycles.

## Bitcoin Dominance Index
The Bitcoin Dominance Index is a metric that traders can use to quickly get a sense of Bitcoin's (BTC) value relative to that of the broader digital currency market. This index, offered by CoinMarketCap, measures Bitcoin's market capitalisation (market cap) compared to the overall market for these digital assets.[1]

Perhaps an easier way to understand Bitcoin dominance is to think of BTC's value as a ratio of the total crypto market cap. According to a historical Bitcoin dominance chart from Statista, this value has been on the decline since 2013. In 2013 Bitcoin enjoyed a dominance ratio upwards of 95%; as of June 2022, this value fell below 40%.[8]

The reasons for the decline in Bitcoin dominance are multifold. The introduction of other crypto assets such as Ethereum (Ether, ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE) certainly expanded the valuation of the entire asset class. Further, a steep decline in Bitcoin's price from November 2021 to June 2022 also prompted Bitcoin to surrender more than 60% of its marketshare in under one year.

Traders can use the Bitcoin Dominance Index to gain insight into the market and more specifically, the sentiment of traders. The price of any asset is a function of supply and demand, so the index effectively measures demand for Bitcoin relative to demand for altcoins. Essentially, as the BTC Dominance Index increases, the demand for BTC is robust in comparison to altcoins and stablecoins. Conversely, if Bitcoin's share of the total cryptocurrency market cap dwindles, it may be said that BTC demand is decreasing.

## Altcoin Season Index
It shows if altcoins outperforming BTC or BTC outperforming altcoins. If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last season (90 days) it is Altcoin Season. Excluded from the Top 50 are Stablecoins (Tether, DAI…) and asset backed tokens (WBTC, stETH, cLINK,…)

## Dollar Cost Averaging Bitcoin
Bitcoin dollar cost averaging consists in investing a fixed amount of USD, into BTC, on regular time intervals. You’ll often see it referenced by its abbreviation of "DCA".

Purchasing $10 every week, for example, would be dollar cost averaging.

This strategy is mostly used by investors that are looking to purchase Bitcoin for the long-term, since it protects them from potentially allocating all their capital at a price peak.

## Corelation study
In the world of cryptocurrency, "correlation" refers to the degree to which the price movements of different cryptocurrencies or crypto assets are similar or related. Correlation is a statistical measure that ranges from -1 to +1. A correlation of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, meaning that the price movements of two assets are perfectly synchronized. A correlation of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, meaning that the price movements of two assets are completely opposite. A correlation of 0 indicates no correlation, meaning that there is no relationship between the price movements of two assets.

In the context of cryptocurrency, understanding the correlation between different assets can be important for investors and traders. For example, if two cryptocurrencies have a high positive correlation, it means that they are likely to move in the same direction and by a similar amount. This can be useful for diversification strategies and risk management. On the other hand, if two cryptocurrencies have a high negative correlation, it means that they are likely to move in opposite directions, which can also be useful for diversification strategies.

## Crypto Fear and Greed Index
This index is similar to the Fear and Greed Index used in the stock market, and it tracks the sentiment of the cryptocurrency market based on a variety of factors such as market volatility, trading volume, and social media activity.

## MVRV z-score
MVRV Z-Score is a bitcoin chart that uses blockchain analysis to identify periods where Bitcoin is extremely over or undervalued relative to its 'fair value'.

It uses three metrics:

1. Market Value (blue line): The current price of Bitcoin multiplied by the number of coins in circulation. This is like market cap in traditional markets i.e. share price multiplied by number of shares.

2. Realised Value (orange line): Rather than taking the current price of Bitcoin, Realised Value takes the price of each Bitcoin when it was last moved i.e. the last time it was sent from one wallet to another wallet. It then adds up all those individual prices and takes an average of them. It then multiplies that average price by the total number of coins in circulation.

In doing so, it strips out the short term market sentiment that we have within the Market Value metric. It can therefore be seen as a more 'true' long term measure of Bitcoin value which Market Value moves above and below depending on the market sentiment at the time.

3. Z-score (red line): A standard deviation test that pulls out the extremes in the data between market value and realised value.
